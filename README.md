# Irrigrow

"Our project aims to automate and streamline irrigation processes by introducing a synchronized system of 'direction and flow controlling' tubes/pipes, strategically placed at canal junctions. This innovative solution empowers farmers to select their desired field and water level, leaving the rest to the automated system. By intelligently adjusting flow direction through motor-controlled junctions and monitoring water levels with sensors, the system efficiently irrigates the entire field while allowing remote control and monitoring through a screen interface. Future enhancements may include a dedicated app for even more convenient control. This automation not only saves time and labor but also has potential applications in detecting channel breaks and optimizing fertilizer distribution to crop roots."
